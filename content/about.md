        Hi!
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm an amateur watercolor artist painting the places and the things that bring me joy. I love being outdoors and find that nature has a way of bringing me some of my favorite poems.
		I paint the places that inspire me and pair the paintings with the words they bring to my mind.
